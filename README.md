 _Last Weather Yesterday_

Last Weather Yesterday is (will be) a weather history application. It will draw current weather data for given locales at three hour intervals from the Open Weather Map API and store it in a database for users to refer back to whenever they want to remember what the weather was like last Wednesday or last month or any time after they signed up.
