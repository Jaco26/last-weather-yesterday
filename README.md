# Last Weather Yesterday

This is a full stack local weather history tracker. As a user, you can save a zip code to the database and the app will grab local weather data for that zip code every hour on the hour and then saves it too. When you log in, you can then navigate the hourly weather for any locale you have chosen to track as far back as the date you submitted that locale's zip code. 

Check out the hosted version on Heroku or spin it up yourself!
